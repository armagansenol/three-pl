# Three.js Vibe Coding Playground

A creative 3D environment built with Three.js, React Three Fiber, and Rapier physics.

## Overview

This project provides an interactive 3D playground with physics simulation, custom shaders, and responsive controls. It's designed as a sandbox for experimenting with Three.js features and creating immersive web experiences.

## Features

- **Physics Simulation**: Powered by Rapier physics engine for realistic object interactions
- **Custom Shaders**: Includes a starry sky shader and custom grass materials
- **Character Controls**: Navigate through the 3D environment with intuitive controls
- **Obstacle Interactions**: Interactive physics-based obstacles
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Ambient and point lighting for depth and atmosphere
- **Camera Controls**: Interactive camera system with mouse rotation

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend framework
- **Three.js**: 3D rendering engine
- **React Three Fiber**: React renderer for Three.js
- **React Three Drei**: Useful helpers for React Three Fiber
- **Rapier**: Physics engine for realistic simulations
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
